THIS FIRMWARE IS NOT FULLY WORKING YET!!!

An alternative firmware for STC15W104 processor + SYN115 radio transmitter door/window reed sensors (8051 based processors).
STC15W104 model has 4KB flash/code space and board also has a tamper detect switch which is nice.

Some sensors have STC15W101 but with only 1KB flash.
However this would not support hardware abstraction layer (unless emulated EEPROM area can be used for code space).

STC does not allow read/verify of written firmware so open source alternative is needed to confirm program behavior.

Boards contain a header that may be populated with pins labeled with G (ground), T (transmit), and R (receive) for programming.

Reprogramming uses:

Firmware uses hardware abstraction layer (HAL):

Proposed features (some added as compared with original firmware):
[1] Transmit on reed switch open/close (i.e., like original firmware)
[2] Transmit on tamper switch opened (i.e., like original firmware)
[3] Ability to select transmission protocol (i.e., any supported by rc-switch)
[4] "Heart beat" mode for periodic transmission (at the expense of battery life)
[5] Adjustable LED blink behavior
[6] Adjustable sleep behavior
[7] User configuration/input with tamper switch press
